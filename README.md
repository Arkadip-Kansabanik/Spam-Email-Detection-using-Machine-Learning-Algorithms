# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

A Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based project for detecting whether an email/SMS message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

This project applies various supervised machine learning algorithms along with TF-IDF feature extraction to build an efficient spam classifier.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails and SMS messages are one of the major challenges in digital communication. This project aims to automatically classify incoming messages into:

- ✅ Ham (Legitimate Message)
- ❌ Spam (Unwanted/Malicious Message)

The project includes:
- Text preprocessing using NLP
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Training multiple ML models
- Comparative performance analysis
- Real-time prediction system

## 📂 Dataset Information

Dataset used: **Spam Email Dataset (`spam.csv`)**

### Dataset Summary

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Total Messages | 5572 |
| Ham Messages | 4825 |
| Spam Messages | 747 |
| Features | Message Text, Label |
| File Format | CSV |
